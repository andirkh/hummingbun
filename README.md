# HummingBun

Simple Static Generator, built upon Bun. a tool to make a blog by writing markdown files.

## How to Start

You need a [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) runtime. Make sure you have one in your system. 

Install dependencies :

```
bun install
```

Open `configuration.json`, set the entryDir. You can use any folder, however the default is `example`. Inside that folder, you only need 2 things: content (markdown files) and asset (any asset you like).

```
üìÅ content (md)
üìÅ asset (js, css, img)
```

How to build and start the server :

```js
bun run serve
```

or, use hot-reloading :

```js
bun run hot-serve
```

Those command above will generate the static file html. If you only want to build the blog, you can use `bun run build`

## How to Update the UI :

the UI is just a multi-line `string`. as long as you know how to modify string in javascript/typescript, you're good to go üëç. no templating language needed. Here's some example :

```typescript
const footer: string = String.raw`
<div>footer</div>
`;

const header = (obj: Content): string => String.raw`
<div>${obj.title}</div>
`;
```

The entry point of the whole blog are HomeUI (home page), PostUI (individual post page), and PageUI (custom page for categories, single page post, etc). If you want to hack more, go to the `/src` folder to update the logic.

## Code Editor

We recommend to use VSCode (it's free) and install the following extension:

- [lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) : the Html Syntax would be available if you write in a string variable.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) : code formatter
